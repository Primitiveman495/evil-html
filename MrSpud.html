            <p> The colorful character Mr. Spud was found dead several weeks ago as many know, but local authorities still remain puzzeled to who could have done it. There has been deliberation if this could have been a suicide, and those arguements seem to be the common concensus between authorities. However, relatives of the late Mr. Spud harshly reject the idea as they believe Mr. Spud could have never done such a thing. They also bring up the fact that there was no way for Mr. Spud to shoot himself in the back of the head 3 times but authorities have rejected this point as nothing but mad ramblings of greived family members. </p>
