            <h1> Kinkle's Pyramid Scheme Ends in Chaos </h1>
            <br>
            <p> The Notorious Kinkle's Grand Pyrmaid Scheme *TM has ended today due to lack of organization within the ranks of Kinkle's Silly Squad *TM. Kinkle, once a prosperous billionaire has lost all of his fortune as well due to bad investments of all of his money on the Hawk Tuah Coin. We here at EVIL website LLC secured an interview with the newly broke Kinkle in exchange for giving Kinkle a half eaten donut and some pocket lint; here is how it went down. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Interviewer: So uh Kinkle, thank you for coming to this interview. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Kinkle: Yeah of course man, hey thanks for that pocket lint and donut also. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Interviewer: Yeah yeah no problem anytime. </p>
            <br>
            <p> This interview gave clever insights onto the inner machinations of Kinkle's head, as his response to the interview ellicited a casual but tight response from Kinkle, which shows how much of a nonchalent dreadhead he is. </p>
