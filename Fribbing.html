            <p> The <em>Fribbing Foundation</em> was a charity dedicated to benefitting the notorious EVIL dooer of Gerard Fribbington. Gerard Fribbington has received over 1.1 million usd in donations for his cause, and has used this money to execute dastardly plots such as dangling multiple innocents over vats of acids in his charity-run warehouse. Recently however this foundation and Gerard himself has been covered over controversy as multiple accounts describe Gerard as doing freaky acts uncharacteristic of the <em>Fribbing Foundation</em> and Gerard himself. </p>
